What Was Accomplished This Week
1. Timeline:
	This week, the timeline was implemented using an online template, and modified with text bubbles to reflect the time stamps we’ll need for the Youtube Player screen. This work was mainly visual, and done by Janna, who will continue by making a function that determines the relative distance of the marker to the end of the line based on the time stamp and total time.    

2. Display YouTube search results: 
	Isaac began to write the JS/HTML required to add YouTube search functionality. Still working on bugs to get the demo working fully. 

Challenges Faced This Week
	Our greatest team challenge this week was coordinating tasks between team members and finding time to meet in person as a group to discuss our progress. We’ve also been struggling with attempting to modify our design/idea despite not having actual video or user data to work from. 

Goals for Status Report 2
1. Share: 
	We will work on the HTML outline for the “Share” pop-up this upcoming week. This will require investigating how to make a pop-up onclick using javascript.

2. Bootstrap:
	By next week, we hope to begin integrating Bootstrap into our project to create a responsive web page. 

3. UI:
	We will begin writing style sheets that reflect our preliminary wireframe designs (created with Adobe Xd) that were submitted in our original design doc.

* "We’ve also been struggling with attempting to modify our design/idea despite not having actual video or user data to work from." => Excellent to hear. This is exactly the problem I want teams to run into in semester project.  It's extremely difficult to implement everything in your original plan.  Keep it simple.
