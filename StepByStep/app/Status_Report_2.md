(1) what was accomplished during the week
	This week we made significant progress. We were able to implement the search feature for the home page â€“ this includes a text entry box, and the search page which populates with search results from Youtube. The results are shown with basic information and thumbnails, and was implemented using the YouTube API. The group has also continued to make significant strides understanding, breaking down, and working with a variety of features of the API.
	Exploratory work continued, as well, with contact pop-up form and the timeline. Both have been implemented to the site in early phases.

(2) challenges and issues team faced during the week
        Accessing API data --> resolved by spinning up local server to address origin policies related to API.
        Considering efficient application architecture --> how our application will store data and interact with user input. Need to draw system diagram.

(3) your goals for the next week.
        Next week, we hope to continue working on the pop-up form and timeline. We also hope to start the video view page, and figure out to play
        specific videos on click from search page. We then will hope to start the main timestamp storage functions.
