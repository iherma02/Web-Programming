1. What was accomplished during the week     
Working prototype with majority of planned features has been built. This includes:    
        - YouTube search
        - Click on any search result to play in a separate development panel.
        - Bookmark any time at the click of a button  
        - Click any timestamp to jump to that point in the video

2. Challenges and issues team faced during the week
        - Integrating YouTube API with iFrame API → figured it out, the two APIs now successfully work in tandem.

3. Your goals for the next week
        - Program sidebar so that it slides back in when “Close” is clicked as well as when any point outside the sidebar (on the main page) is clicked
        - Connect to MongoDB to store timestamps for each video    
        - Publish to Heroku site
