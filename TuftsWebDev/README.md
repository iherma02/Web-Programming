# Learning Portfolio

1. The purpose of the Git repository is to contain all of my completed work for COMP20 (Web Programming) for the Fall 2018 semester. It contains labs and larger assignments.     

2. My favorite assignment was most definitely assignment #2, titled "MBTA". I enjoyed this assignment because it was my first opportunity to practice an implementation of JS with HTML and CSS to build a fully-functional visual prototype. In addition, this assignment was my introduction to and interaction with asynchronous requests for resources on other domains; I truly learned the connective power of the web.

3. This course has allowed me to grow tremendously. Firstly, this course taught me the importance of independent learning in the context of labs and assignments, where instructions may not necessarily be specific. To me, this was a more accurate representation of real-world tasks. I can now confidently approach foreign concepts in web programming, such as using new APIs or implementing packages to speed my development process.  

4. The most important concept I learned in this course was the model of AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML). This model has allowed me to implement dynamic web pages that serve useful, updated information without reloading entire web pages to do so. One example is assignment #2, where I successfully used the AJAX model to make asynchronous HTTP requests from the MBTA API to provide updated train information to the webpage. Another example is my semester group project, where my foundational understanding of the asynchronous model allowed me to correctly implement the iFrame API (a subset of the YouTube Data API).

5. Now that I have finished the course, a goal for myself is to improve my understanding of the server-side components of web programming. More specifically, I would like to improve my ability to navigate databases. These skills will allow me to create and understand technology interfaces for my other academic interests (quant. economics), so that I can record and query useful data and provide data-driven insights for modeling purposes.
