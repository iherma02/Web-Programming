1. All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly. One slight problem: the first click on a station once the page is loaded does not load the corresponding data from MBTA. After that first click, all subsequent stations load appropriate data on the first click.

2. I did not work on the assignment with anyone. I utilized the given examples on the Comp20 Github to implement the geolocation services, and utilized the Google Maps API documentation to better understand the included objects and functions.

3. I spent approximately 12 hours working on the assignment.
