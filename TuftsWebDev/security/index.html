                <h3>Assignment #3 Security Assessment (Target: Ming)</h3>
                <h4>Isaac Herman, Comp20 F'18</h4>

                <ol>
                        <li>Introduction</li>
                        <h5>Description of the Product:</h5>
                        <p>The product in question is a web application that maintains final scores and grids for all players of the game 2048.
                        The application, accessible at <a target="_blank" href="https://gameserver2048.herokuapp.com/">https://gameserver2048.herokuapp.com/</a>,
                        and it is deployed on Heroku, using Node.js and the Express web framework combined with MongoDB to store records for a long period of time.</p>

                        <h5>What I was Hired to Do:</h5>
                        <p>I was hired to perform a web security assessment of the product. This includes finding and evaluating vulnerabilities,
                        as well as making recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities.</p>

                        <li>Methodology</li>
                        <p>First, I engaged in "black-box" testing of the application, using the command line tool known as "curl" to submit POST requests.
                        In addition, utilized MongoDB query commands in the web URL to access the database records.</p>

                        <p>After this first phase of testing, I looked at the code to find the source of the vulnerabilities, and performed further "white-box" testing.
                        Upon viewing the code, I was able to make specific recommendations.</p>

                        <li>Abstract of Findings</li>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
                                <p>A vulnerability was found that allows anyone on the internet to submit malicious code to application.
                                The malicious code is then executed by the application itself. This vulnerability has the potential to ruin the user experience of the application.</p>

                                <li>NoSQL Injection</li>
                                <p>A vulnerability was found that allows users to manipulate the URL in their web browswer in order to access all records stored by the application.</p>

                                <li>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</li>
                                <p>A vulnerability was found that grants access to the to the application's resources to any domain on the internet.
                                This has the potential to be a disastrous vulnerability if a malicious domain requests and receives access. </p>
                        </ol>

                        <li>Issues Found</li>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)</li>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>Location</li>
                                        <p>This issue was found on line 20 of server.js, inside the "/submit" POST route.</p>
                                        <pre>Line 20: var username = request.body.username;</pre>

                                        <li>Severity of Issue</li>
                                        <p>This issue is of HIGH severity. XSS attacks have potential to ruin the user experience of your application,
                                        by redirecting pages, displaying persistent alerts, or rendering innappropriate content on the screen.</p>

                                        <li>Description of Issue</li>
                                        <p>The XSS vulnerability arises because the server is taking in user input, WITHOUT sanitizing it first.
                                        Therefore, anyone on the web has ability to submit malicious JavaScript code that can redirect the page, display alerts, etc.</p>

                                        <li>Proof of Vulnerability</li>

                                                <figcaption>Curl command used to submit malicious JS code to display alert.</figcaption>
                                        </figure>
                                        <figure>
                                                <img src="XSSServerResults.png" alt="XSS Server Results" width="50%">
                                                <figcaption>Input was not sanitized, this code is stored in the database (see last entry) and will execute upon display. </figcaption>
                                        </figure>

                                        <li>Resolution</li>
                                        <p>To resolve this issue, it would be best to remove all special characters from user input. "NEVER TRUST USER INPUT".
                                        An example of how to do this: </p>
                                        <pre>string = string.replace(/[&\/\\#,+()$~%.'":*?<>{}]/g, '');</pre>
                                        <p>By removing special characters, the user will not be able to pass JavaScript code to the server to be executed.</p>

                                        <p>It would also be wise to limit the character count of the user input using the maxlength attribute, by doing something like this: </p>
                                        <xmp><form action="/action_page.php">
  Username: <input type="text" name="usrname" maxlength="10"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form></xmp>
                                </ul>

                                <li>NoSQL Injection</li>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>Location</li>
                                        <p>This issue was found on line 58 of server.js, inside the "/scores.json" GET route.</p>
                                        <pre>Line 58: var usernameEntry = request.query.username;</pre>

                                        <li>Severity of Issue</li>
                                        <p>This issue is of HIGH severity. The NoSQL injection attack in this example has successfully displayed ALL records on the database.
                                        In reality, if this database contained sensitive information, this vulnerability could be taken advantage of to gain access to large amounts of the sensitive information, simply by manipulating the URL.</p>

                                        <li>Description of Issue</li>
                                        <p>Similar to the XSS attack above, this injection vulnerability results in the fact that user input (URL query string in this case) is not sanitized before processing.
                                        Ultimately, special characters can be placed in the query string, such as the [] or $ that the server interprets as MongoDB search qualifiers.</p>

                                        <li>Resolution</li>
                                        <p>Similar to the XSS attack, it would be best to sanitize the query string before executing a request in the Mongo database. An example of how to do this: </p>
                                        <pre><pre>string = string.replace(/[&\/\\#,+()$~%.'":*?<>{}]/g, '');</pre></pre>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                        <li>Location</li>
                                        <p>This issue is found on lines 17 and 55 of server.js, inside the '/submit' POST route and '/scores.json' GET route.</p>
                                        <pre>response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</pre>

                                        <li>Severity of Issue</li>
                                        <p>This issue is of HIGH severity. This is because any site on the web can be granted access to the requested resource.</p>

                                        <li>Description of Issue</li>
                                        <p>The lines in question mean that ANY (*) site on the web can access the information stored on the server.</p>
                                        <p>This is known as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and is a dangerous web development practice.</p>


                                        <li>Proof of vulnerability</li>
                                        <figure>

                                        </figure>


                                        <li>Resolution</li>
                                        <p>For future use, it is best to disable CORS and specifiy the domains that can have access to the resource in question. For example: </p>
                                        <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://foo.example</pre>
                                        <p>will only allow the domain http://foo.example to access the resource. </p>

                                </ul>
                        </ol>

                        <li>Conclusion</li>
                        <p>Ultimately, the vulnerabilities found in this web application are among the most pervasive vulnerabilities found on the internet.
                        Luckily, and perhaps for that very reason, the fixes are quite easy to implement.</p>

                        <p>Firstly, it is important to never trust user inmput. More specifically, all user input should be sanitized of special characters, so that
                        malicious actors on the web cannot feed JavaScript code or html elements to the page. Additionally, user input should be capped at a specific character limit.
                        The same goes for query strings through the URL, which can have special characters removed to prevent MongoDB  queries.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, it is imperative that CORS be disabled, especially if the application aims to store more sensitive information.</p>

                        <p>With web security measures comes tradeoffs, however. Firstly, implementing the above changes pertaining to user input will limit user choice and length of username.
                        This should not affect much at all. However, disabling CORS will change the essential purpose and functionality of the application. Instead of users (from any domain)
                        using the application to view scores, this feature will be limited to only specified domains. </p>
